    http://localhost:5500
    http://127.0.0.1


									Web Page
								-------------------------
- It is a hyper text document that provides an UI from where user can intereact with the resources in applications.
- The term "hyper" refers to "beyond".
- A hyper text document provides content on screen and naviagates user beyond the content to access details.
- web pages are classfied into 2 types:
    a) Static Page
    b) Dynamic Page

    Static Page:
    ------------
	- Static refers to continuous memory
	- Memory allocated to first request will continue for next set of requests.
	- Static page comprises of same information to display across any number of requests
	- Static page have extensions
	    a) .htm
	    b) .html

    Dynamic Page:
    -------------
    	- Dynamic refers to discrete memory
	- It is disconnected memory
	- Memory is newly allocated for every request
	- Dynamic page comprises content customized  according to client request.
	- Dynamic page have extensions
	    a) .jsp
	    b) .php
	    c) .asp
	    d) .aspx
	    etc...  

    NOTE: HTML is a language use to design both static and dynamic pages.
	  How ever the dynamic page composition comprises of business logic in backend.



									HTML
								-------------------
- Hyper Text Markup Language
- Hyper means beyond
- Markup refers to the term marking up, which is a process of preparing our content to present exactly as required.
- HTML is a markup language used to present content on "Browser".


Evolution of HTML
------------------
- Internet started with a browser called "Mosaic".
- CERN labs developed a language called GML later improved as SGML.
- GML & SGML are markup languages used for Mosaic.
	CERN => Council for European Research & Nuclear
	GML  => Genreic Markup Language
	SGML => Standard Generic Markup Language

- Tim Berners developed HTML as super set to GML & SGML in early 1990.
- IETF [ Internet Engineering Task Force ] developed several versions of HTML.
- IETF developed up to 3.1 version.
- WHATWG [ Web Hyper Text Application Technology Work Group ] started , maintaining and envolving HTML since 2004 [ HTML 4 ]
- The latest version of HTML is HTML5. [ 2014 ]

								Browser Architecture
							-------------------------------------
- Browser is a software tool used by clients to access and view resources on web.
- The popular browsers
    a) Chrome
    b) Firefox
    c) Safari
    d) Edge
    e) Opera
    etc...

1. User Interface
    - UI comprises of tabs, navigation buttons, plugins, workspace etc..
    - UI also comprises of development tools.

2. UI Backend
    - It provides the logic for UI.
    - All UI elements are controlled by using UI backend.
    - If you are using any open source browser then you can customize UI backend.

3. Browser Engine
    - It translates HTML & CSS.
    - Every browser have its own engine, which leads to compatibility issues.
	
	Chrome  	V8 		Blink
	IE		Chakra 		Trident
	Firefox		Gecko		SpiderMonkey	
	Safari		Webkit 		Nitro
	Edge		EdgeHTML 	Chakra
	Opera		Blink		V8

4. JavaScript Interpreter
    - It is responsible for translating JavaScript in browser.
    - In browser JS is translated line-by-line, which is known as interpreting.

5. Rendering Engine
    - Rendering is the process of generating output
    - Every browser have a rendering engine, which is responsible for rendering output generated through HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

6. Networking
    - It handles the request from client.
    - It connects to server and loads all resources requested by client.
    - It allows developers to monitor the resources.

    NOTE: Every webpage loads as a result of browser "DOMContentLoaded" event.

7. Data Persistence
    - Every browser stores data.
    - Data storage in browser can be managed using
	a) Local Storage
	b) Session Storage
	c) Extension Storage
	d) Cache Storage
	e) Cookies 
	etc...
	
    - Storage are temporary & permanent.

									HTML PAGE STRUCTURE
								-------------------------------------
1. A static page can have extension
    a) .html
    b) .htm

    FAQ: What is difference between .html & .htm ?
    Ans: Technically both are same.
	 ".htm" is extension given for page according to naming conventions.
	
		index.html		=> add into root level of your project
		index.htm

		D:\Brand-Factory
		|
		|_public
		|   |_images
		|   |_docs
		|   |_video
		|
		|_src
		|   |_styles
		|   |_script
		|   |_scss
		|
		|_index.html
		|_package.json
		|_readme.md

2. Every HTML page design in 5 version starts with "Document Declaration".
    <!DOCTYPE html>
	- Document declaration specifies version and language used for markup.
	- It is new from HTML 5.
	- Hence if document declaration is defined then page is using HTML 5 version.

3. Every web page have a document scope.
    <html>
	document scope
    </html>

4. Every document scope requires a language to configure to define the origin.
    <html lang="en-in">			 -----------------------------
					|      html      => element   |
    </html>				|      </html>   => token    
					|      <

    - It is an internationalization rule according to web principles
    - "lang" is an attribute of HTML element

    syntax:
    -------
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en-in">
	</html>

5. Every HTML document comprises of 2 sections at high level
    a) <head>
    b) <body>

    - Content in body section are loaded as a result of round-trip.
    - Content in heaad section will save round-trip. They are cached and loaded.

    Diagram Representation: C:\Users\koush\OneDrive\JavaFullStackDeveloper\UI TECHNOLOGIES\HTML

   FAQ: what is round-trip ?
   ans: It is the process of loading resources every time from server.

   FAQ: How to save round-trip ?
   ans: By caching the content.

   FAQ: What is caching ?
   ans: It is the process of storing frequently requested content into buffer [ temporary memory ].

   Head Section:
   -------------
	- It allows to cache the content.
	- It saves round-trip.
	- Typically web pages keep following content in head section
	    a) <title>
	    b) <link> 
	    c) <meta>
   	    d) <base>
	    e) <script>
	    f) <style>

	    (a) Title:
	    -----------
		- It is used to display page title in browser title bar.
		- It is used in bookmarking page.
		- It is also used in SEO [ Search Engine Organization ].
		Ex:
		    <!DOCTYPE html>
		    <html lang = "en-in">
    			<head>
			    <title>Brand Factory</title>
    			</head>
		    </html>

	    (b) Link Element:
	    -----------------
		- It allows to link any external document to page, which includes favicons, style sheets etc...

	    	Creating and Adding a "Favicon" to Web Page
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~			NOTE: Favicon must have extention ".ico" and size
		1. Go to your project "public" folder					16 x 16 pixels to 32 x 32 pixels
		2. Add a new folder into public by name "assets"			Every Web page size must be
		3. Add a new file into assets by name "favico.ico"			1200 px width
		4. Open your favicon in ms-paint					740 px height
		5. set page size to max 32 x 32 pixels
		6. Design your icon										
		7. Save
		8. Go to HTML page and link favicon							Ex:
													    <!DOCTYPE html>
			<link>										    <html>
			<rel>	: It specifies the file type   |						<head>
				  "stylesheet" for css	       | ----> 	<link rel = "shortcut icon">		    <title> Web Development </title>
				  "shortcut icon" for favicon  |						    <link rel = "shortcut icon" href= "assets/favicon.ico">
														</head>
			href	: It is hyper reference        |					    </html>	
				  virtual path or file 	       | ----> 	href = "assets/favicon,ico"
													NOTE: . There is no order dependency of element in head section.
		 	syntax: 									      . There is no order dependency of attributes in element.
			    <link rel = "shortcut icon" href = "assets/favicon.ico">


		FAQ: what is difference between "src" and "href"?
		ans: "src" is a getter, it is used to get the path and display the file.
		     "href" is a setter, it is used to set the path and access the file.


	    (c) Meta Element:
	    -----------------
		- Meta stands for "meta-data".
		- Usually meta data comprises of information about your page, provided to Web Crawlers and Web Spiders.
		- Web Crawlers and Web Spiders.
		- SEO [ Search Engine Optimization ]
		- Meta is one of the option for making page SEO freindly and responsive.
		  [ Responsive page fits according to device and browser ]

		syntax:				UTF : Unicode Transformation Format			8  Bit => for English [us, gb, in]
		    <meta charset = "utf-8">	It is used by BOTS to know the language used in page	16 Bit => for Korean, Japanese etc.

			Difference between <html lang = "en-in"> and <meta charset = "utf-8">
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			<html lang="en-in"     -> Google Engine
			<meta charset="utf-8"> -> SEO
		    				

		- through meta we also request headers
		  syntax:
		      <meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "4">
			  content in seconds
    </html>
