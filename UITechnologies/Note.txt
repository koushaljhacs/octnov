Hi, i'm koushal jha. 
I completed my higher secondary education in kolkata, after that and in 2023. i joined GLA University, Mathura, to pursue a B.Tech in computer science engineering.
During my studies, as a third year B.Tech student, i built a strong foundation in Java programming language and expanded into scripting lanaguages python and Javascript. I have also hands-on experience with Node.js and  springboot microservices, and basic knowledge of React.JS. My skills related to QUERY lanaguage included this software Oracle DB and Postgresql.
I'm passionate about AI, and my short term goal is to improve my prompt so that AI can better understand my needs. Looking ahead, i aim to become a java full stack developer with AI expertise. I'm also interested in architecture design, including firewall design, and i enjoy leading projects, managing teams, and effective time management.
so currently, i'm researching and building a company in stealth mode, exploring innovative solutions in AI and software architecture.
So, This video is part of my university CCTP Program, preparing for ourselves in upcoming job to face interviews.
Thankyou for watching


PROFESSIONAL INTRODUCTION SCRIPT - KOUSHAL JHA

[SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION]
Hello, my name is Koushal Jha. I am currently a third-year Computer Science 
Engineering student at GLA University, Mathura. My academic journey began 
in Kolkata, and since 2023, I have been dedicated to mastering the core 
principles of software engineering and system design.

[SECTION 2: TECHNICAL EXPERTISE]
My technical foundation is built on Java, which I have utilized to develop 
complex logic and backend systems. I have also expanded my versatility into 
scripting with Python and JavaScript. My specialized stack includes Node.js 
and Spring Boot Microservices, complemented by a working knowledge of 
React.js. For data management, I am proficient in PostgreSQL and Oracle DB.

[SECTION 3: FEATURED PROJECT]
Applying these skills, I developed an AI-Integrated Hostel Management System. 
This project allowed me to demonstrate a full-stack and DevOps mindset. 
I built the application using Node.js and PostgreSQL, but more importantly, 
I managed the deployment lifecycle myself. I implemented a CI/CD pipeline 
and configured a local server environment using Nginx and ngrok to handle 
traffic and tunneling. This experience gave me hands-on insight into how 
software operates in a live, networked environment.

[SECTION 4: LEADERSHIP & STEALTH VENTURE]
Beyond development, I am deeply interested in Software Architecture and 
Cybersecurity, specifically firewall design. I am also an advocate for 
AI Prompt Engineering, as I believe the future of development lies in the 
synergy between human intent and AI execution. 

Currently, I am operating in stealth mode, researching and building a company 
dedicated to exploring innovative AI solutions. This venture is where I apply 
my passion for project management, team leadership, and strategic time management.

[SECTION 5: CONCLUSION]
This video is part of my university’s CCTP Program, which focuses on 
professional readiness and interview preparation for the upcoming 
recruitment season. My goal is to transition into a Java Full-Stack 
Developer role where I can contribute my AI expertise and leadership skills. 

Thank you for your time and for watching.
